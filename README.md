# thesis-unity-prototype
The prototype was built in Unity using C#. It includes mechanisms for handling spatial grids, real world coordinate translation into unity coordinate system and the generation of  elements based on location and input. Agent responses are stored and visualized as spatial data, allowing patterns and clusters to emerge.
The uploaded scripts represent selected systems from the larger Unity prototype.
